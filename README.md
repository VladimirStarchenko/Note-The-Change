# Note The Change

## A LITTLE ABOUT THE APP...

In this assignment the main objective was to create a notetaker app that can succesfully push a note title and note text into an array of objects.
Succesfully this was made possible using express.js. 
Below is the entry page the user will first see. The Get Started button uses event handlers connected with express 'CRUD' methods to GET the notes.html page

Here we see the generated page that we get when we click the homescreen button. So far as a new user no Notes are in the left hand coloumn as indicated by the block of text. 
So far what you can do is limited aside from creating a new note. So let's do that!

The note below is given a title of the date at the time of entry along with an emoticon for fun üòÅ. From here we need only press the floppy disk or 'save' icon in the top right hand corner to save our note to the left hand side's coloumn of notes. We can also press the ‚ûï icon if we're unsatisifed with our note and want to start on a blank slate.

So here we are our new note! Now we see one additional icon next to our saved not. The trash bin. If need be you can delete the note by clicking the trash icon and clean
up your workspace.

## HOW TO USE THE APP...

In order to use this app succesfully clone this file to your computer. 

Next open up git bash and cd into the root of your folder and enter ``` npm start ```

This will get the server running. From here you only need to input into your search bar [localhost:3001](https://localhost:3001)
